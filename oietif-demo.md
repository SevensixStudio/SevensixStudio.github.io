In the recent time, I've been working on a new malware codenamed OIETIF.

It will feature two main things I never used in my malware before - one of them being a part that destroys your hardware or at least makes your computer not boot anymore at all, as showcased in this video.

The other one is still a secret and not implemented yet. But let's just say it's going to be a game.

PLEASE READ THE FAQ BEFORE ASKING ANY QUESTIONS:

## How does this exploit work?
It's not really an exploit, it's more of a feature some hardware doesn't protect against abusing it. I won't tell how exactly it works for now.

## Does it really destroy the hardware?
It doesn't let the magic smoke out, but it can't be fixed by reinstalling the OS as the computer won't boot anymore.

## Does it work on any PC?
It works on some PCs - especially older, XP-era ones. The flaw used is more universal than the one used by CIH but it probably won't work on your modern EFI PC. It did work on a fairly modern thin client from 2013 though.

## Is it possible to recover from it?
Yes, but not easily without soldering or a self-built mod adapter. The machine used on this video was actually prepared to be easily restorable in a few seconds - only recovering the OS itself takes long due to it overwriting a lot of the file system.

## What else can it do? / Where are the memes?
Nothing at the moment. But the hardware destruction is just one of the two planned main aspects, of which the other one will be the actual fun part.

## What does OIETIF mean?
OIETIF is an acronym for something random I did during planning the second part of the malware. Nobody really knows what it means, I forgot it myself. But I wanted to kind of share I'm working on something new so I randomly posted this word, making it an inside joke in my community. Some people made up their own meanings like "Open Internet Explorer to install Firefox" or "Once I execute this, I'm fucked", which is actually pretty clever but not right.

## Release when?
Never. This is way too dangerous to give away.

## Source Code?
The source code won't be released either.

## No Release = Fake
Just like VineMEMZ and Bonzify were fake until they somehow got real after I published the source code. Why would I lie to my community like this?

## This video has obviously been edited because of _________, so it's definetely fake!
Yes, this video has been edited. It takes like an hour to fix the system and set everything up again after a messed up recording. So I rather cut out shitty parts than wasting a whole day of trying to get a good video without any cuts. Does that make the malware fake? No.

## Can you give it just me so I can carefully test it inside a VM :)
No. Also running this in a VM doesn't make sense anyway because it can't access the hardware.

## Shut up and take my money!
You can't buy it either.

## Why is there a download link available then?
Any download links that aren't shared officially by me are probably a scam, bootleg or reupload. Because OIETIF will never officially get released, your link is fake. Also keep in mind there are imposters out there trying to make a profit using false claims.
